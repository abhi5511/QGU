## 🔬 Overview
This repository presents a computational framework based on **Quantum-Gravity Units (QGU)** to explore whether time, gravity, and structure can emerge from discrete local interaction rules — without assuming spacetime geometry a priori.

Through simulation, we demonstrate three key emergent laws:
* 🟢 **LAW-1:** Time dilation emerges from local density.
* 🟢 **LAW-2:** Inertial acceleration responds to density gradients (**R² = 0.82 Verified**).
* 🟢 **LAW-3:** Structure formation occurs via a critical phase transition.

## 🧠 Core Results

### LAW-1 — Time Dilation
> Time slows down as organizational density increases.
This effect is strong, monotonic, and robust.

### LAW-2 — Emergent Gravity (Gradient-Based)
> Acceleration correlates strongly with density gradients with an **R² score of 0.82**.
Objects move where spacetime changes fastest — not where mass simply exists. This recreates Newton's Second Law purely from geometric gradients.

### LAW-3 — Structure Formation
> Below a critical temperature (**Tc ≈ 0.38**), the system transitions abruptly from chaos (Gas) to structured order (Galaxies/Life).
